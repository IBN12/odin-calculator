The Odin Project: Calculator Project

This is the second version of The Odin Project: Calculator project.
The first project used basic arrays and some implementation problems with the
algorithms for the number-pad and operator-pad functions. This verison uses
objects/associative arrays instead.

The basic guideline for the project is complete. There is a add(), subtract(),
multiply(), and division() function in the javascript file. These functions perform
all the heavy arithmetic, whereas, the operatorPad() and numberPad() functions
contain algorithmic if-statements to display certain expressions on the calculator-screen, 
and perform basic arithmetic through the operator-pad keys (+, -, /, *) and operator() function.  

I will complete the extra credit and add more CSS to the page and calculator during my
next few commits. I will also clean up the JavaScript file a little a more and get rid of 
the console.log tests alongside its comments. These test were implemented to see if the
functions worked effectively with the objectContainer that holds 
four properties: numOne, numTwo, value, and operator. 

Still more to come.
